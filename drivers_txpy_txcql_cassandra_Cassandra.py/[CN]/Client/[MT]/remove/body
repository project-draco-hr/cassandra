def remove(self, key, column_path, timestamp, consistency_level):
    '\n    Remove data from the row specified by key at the granularity specified by column_path, and the given timestamp. Note\n    that all the values in column_path besides column_path.column_family are truly optional: you can remove the entire\n    row by just specifying the ColumnFamily, or you can remove a SuperColumn or a single Column by specifying those levels too.\n\n    Note that counters have limited support for deletes: if you remove\n    a counter, you must wait to issue any following update until the\n    delete has reached all the nodes and all of them have been fully\n    compacted.\n\n    Parameters:\n     - key\n     - column_path\n     - timestamp\n     - consistency_level\n    '

This is because Cassandra is schema-less and there are no\n        guarantees that a given column exists.\n\n        When the COUNT aggregate function is specified as a column to fetch, a\n        single row will be returned, with a single column named "count" whose\n        value is the number of rows from the pre-aggregation resultset.\n\n        The MAX and MIN functions can be used to compute the maximum and the\n        minimum value returned by a query for a given column.\n\n        The SUM function can be used to sum up all the values returned by\n        a query for a given column.\n\n        The AVG function can be used to compute the average of all the\n        values returned by a query for a given column.\n        '

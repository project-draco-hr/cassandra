The first form allows the specification of a precise row\n        by specifying a particular primary key value (if the primary key has\n        multiple columns, values for each must be given). The second form\n        allows a list of key values to be specified using the IN operator\n        and a parenthesized list of comma-delimited key values.\n        "

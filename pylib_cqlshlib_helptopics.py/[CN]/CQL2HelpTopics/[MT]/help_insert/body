No results are returned.\n\n        Values for all component columns in the table's primary key must\n        be given. Also, there must be at least one non-primary-key column\n        specified (Cassandra rows are not considered to exist with only\n        a key and no associated columns).\n\n        Unlike in SQL, the semantics of INSERT and UPDATE are identical.\n        In either case a record is created if none existed before, and\n        udpated when it does. For more information, see one of the\n        following:\n\n          HELP UPDATE\n          HELP UPDATE_USING\n          HELP CONSISTENCYLEVEL\n        "

It appears\n        after the BEGIN BATCH statement, and uses the standard "consistency\n        level specification" (see HELP CONSISTENCYLEVEL). Batched statements\n        default to CONSISTENCY.ONE when left unspecified.\n\n        Only data modification statements (specifically, UPDATE, INSERT,\n        and DELETE) are allowed in a BATCH statement. BATCH is _not_ an\n        analogue for SQL transactions.\n\n        _NOTE: While there are no isolation guarantees, UPDATE queries are\n        atomic within a given record._\n        '

Valid names are any string constructed of alphanumeric\n        characters and underscores. Names which do not work as valid\n        identifiers or integers should be quoted as string literals. Properties\n        such as replication strategy and count are specified during creation\n        using the following accepted keyword arguments:\n\n          strategy_class [required]: The name of the replication strategy class\n          which should be used for the new keyspace. Some often-used classes\n          are SimpleStrategy and NetworkTopologyStrategy.\n\n          strategy_options: Most strategies require additional arguments which\n          can be supplied by appending the option name to "strategy_options",\n          separated by a colon (:). For example, a strategy option of "DC1"\n          with a value of "1" would be specified as "strategy_options:DC1 = 1".\n          The replication factor option for SimpleStrategy could be\n          "strategy_options:replication_factor=3".\n        '
